# Tenable-Challenge

For the Tenable Interview Coding Challenge I was asked to make 4 separate pages to display my skills with HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, and a framework of my choosing. I chose to use Angular2 for my frontend. Also for this application, I decided to make a REST API using Spring Boot so that way my projects could call data in real time from a MySQL database.
